# Movie-Recommendations-using-R-programming-
R code snippet demonstrates the creation of a movie recommendation system. It begins by loading the necessary library, 'recommenderlab,' and constructs a sample dataset representing user ratings for different movies. The data is organized into a user-item matrix, a crucial structure for recommendation systems. Using collaborative filtering, the code builds a recommendation model based on user preferences. It then showcases how to retrieve movie recommendations for a specific user and displays the suggested movie names. This example serves as a basic introduction to building a movie recommendation system in R, illustrating the key steps from data loading to generating personalized movie suggestions.
